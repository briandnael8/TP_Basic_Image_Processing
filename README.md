# TP_Basic_Image_Processing

This repository contains a lab on basic image processing using Python. The lab demonstrates the application of various image processing techniques through a series of steps and examples. The main focus is on the implementation and visualization of the Harris Corner Detection algorithm.

## Summary

The lab is divided into the following sections:

1. **Setup and Library Imports**: 
   - Initialization of the environment with necessary libraries, including NumPy, OpenCV, Scipy, Matplotlib, Skimage, and PIL for image processing tasks.

2. **Harris Corner Detection Implementation**:
   - A custom implementation of the Harris Corner Detection algorithm is provided. It involves calculating image gradients, smoothing with a Gaussian filter, computing a corner response function, and identifying potential corner points based on a threshold.

3. **Image Processing Techniques Demonstrated**:
   - Techniques such as image gradient computation (using Sobel filters), Gaussian smoothing, and corner detection are illustrated.
   - Examples show how changing the parameters affects the detection results.

4. **Example Applications**:
   - The lab includes examples using two grayscale images (`CircleLineRect.png` and `zurlim.png`), showcasing the corner detection results.
   - Users are encouraged to try different parameter settings and use their own images for further exploration.
